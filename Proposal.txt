 Missiles
In this project we will make a game in which a helicopter will be shown on a screen and it can be flown all around the screen using the arrow keys and
it will have to dodge the missiles that will constantly trace the helicopter. The speed of the missile will be slightly greater than the helicopter. 
The missiles will also blow up by colliding with one another. The score will increase linearly with time. 
Their will be stars that will be spawned at random positions which will increase the score by 10 if the helicopter catches them. 
This program will use AI searching algorithms to find shortest path. ( we can resort to use Minmax algorithm incase Time complexity increaser)
